    <!--help_page.xml-->
    <string name="q1">What is the Perm label in app backup?</string>
    <string name="a1"><i>Perm</i> means permissions of an app. Migrate can backup the granular permissions granted to an app for Android Marshmallow (6.0) and above.\n
    Selecting the option will allow you to restore the app permissions when the app is restored.
    </string>
    <string name="q2">How is this app different from Titanium Backup?</string>
    <string name="a2">This app is a ROM migration tool. This app can:\n
        \u2022 Combines all app and data to TWRP flashable zip\n
        \u2022 Backup different extras like contacts, sms, call logs etc\n
        \u2022 Higher portability because you have to carry only few zip files\n
        \u2022 Backups, if needed, can be flashed on another device.\n
    </string>
    <string name="q3">But why not use nandroid backup instead?</string>
    <string name="a3">Nandroid backup is the safest backup option available. However you cannot restore apps from one nandroid backup to a new ROM.\n
    This app is necessarily a ROM migration tool. Nandroid backup cannot do that job.
    </string>
    <string name="q4">Why can\'t all the apps and data be restored from the recovery itself?</string>
    <string name="a4">Recovery is a different environment from Android OS. Imaging installing a Windows game from a Linux distro.\n\n
    So a helper app is injected into the system partition, which fires up on system boot. It takes root permission and automatically restores app and data.
    </string>
    <string name="q5">Do I need to download the Migrate app from Play Store to restore the backup zip?</string>
    <string name="a5">
        Absolutely not!\n\n
        All you need is TWRP recovery and that your new ROM be rooted. While flashing backup zip, a helper app is injected into system, which takes up the app restore process.
    </string>
    <string name="q6">Is TWRP necessary? Can\'t I restore backup without it?</string>
    <string name="a6">
        TWRP recovery is needed to flash the backup zip. Without that, you cannot restore a backup. Other recoveries may work, but is not tested.\n\n
        Currently Migrate does not support restoring zips from the app itself. But that is something which can be added in future.
    </string>
    <string name="q7">Is it necessary to use Magisk?</string>
    <string name="a7">
        This app works best with Magisk. SuperSU has not been tested. Lineage OS su addon sometimes work but sometimes give very weird errors. So please use Magisk.

        2. Private data of apps (compressed and stored)\n
        Apk content of apps are not analysed. Private data of apps are not analysed.\n\n

        For extra backups, the following are read, only after permission from user:\n
        1. Contacts data (stored as vcf file)\n
        2. SMS data (stored as a db file)\n
        3. Call logs (stored as a db file)\n
        4. Screen DPI, default keyboard, ADB state, Font scale\n
        5. Wifi store config file (Android 8.0+)\n\n

        All data read are stored locally on the device

    <string name="what_is_shared">What is shared</string>
    <string name="what_is_shared_desc">
        Sharing in this context refers to voluntary reporting of app logs.\n\n
        On sharing logs, you agree to share (publicly, if on Telegram group):\n\n
        - Some internal file structure of apps. This (in most cases) does not contain personally identifiable sensitive information.\n
        - The backup name.\n
        - Some backup details like number of backup parts.\n
        - Device information like android version.\n\n
        Migrate highly respects privacy of users. As such logs generated during back up of contacts, sms and call logs are NOT RECORDED and not sharable.
        No intentional attempt is made to identify or make illicit use of personal data of users.\n\n
        In any case, you agree that neither the developer, nor is the app responsible for any unintentional breach of privacy.
        In case you feel that your logs may contain sensitive information, please don\'t share them.
        In case you have already shared, please request for their deletion as soon as possible.
    </string>
    <string name="what_is_intentional">What is \"No intentional attempt\"?</string>
    <string name="what_is_intentional_desc">
        As a developer, I want users to understand this point. Again, this is applicable only if you decide to share the logs.\n\n
        Migrate uses the linux \"tar\" utility to compress data files. As such, tar prints out file names it has processed, and this also helps to identify if there are any errors in the process. Contents of the files are not printed.\n\n
        Usually it is not possible to detect personally identifiable information from cryptic output of tar files.
        But in some rare cases, developers may not follow proper practices and place information on the file name itself.
        Example: a chat app storing chat preferences with a participant as a file with name as the phone number of the participant. In this case, tar will print the name of the file, thus exposing the phone number. This is just one example.\n\n
        Migrate cannot take responsibility of putting a custom filter for each of the millions of apps out there, fearing that they don\'t by mistake leak any information.\n\n
        Again this is a VERY rare case, and usually always goes unnoticed. This happened with previous versions of Migrate and I got suggestion from few users that this be known to everyone.\n
        You can continue to use Migrate as you have done.

    <string name="avoid_unintentional_leak">I am still not convinced.</string>
    <string name="avoid_unintentional_leak_desc">
        As discussed previously, if you think your backup contains really sensitive data, please do not share logs. Nothing leaves your device if you do not voluntarily share logs.
        <b>However, also note that without logs it becomes nearly impossible to provide any kind of support.\n\n</b>
        Alternatively, you can choose to not share \"Progress log\". The \"Error log\" and other options are usually most important.
